# CS190_MPSOCO
A repo from my research entitled "A Modified Particle Swarm Optimizer with Crossover Operator (M-PSOCO) using Dynamic Inertia Weight." This study follows through Chen's research entitled "Particle swarm optimizer with crossover operation" by modifying the inertia weight parameter. This study will carry out two adaptive inertia weight methods and will be compared to a linearly decreasing weight Paarticle Swarm Optimization (PSO.)

PSO is an algorithm based on multiple particles, grouped as a collective swarm "flying" over a search area with the sole purpose of approximating the solution of a given numerical problem, say, minimization of a function to its nearest actual solution. This results to a time-efficient usage of multiple agents to cooperate in solution-finding versus the  traditional approaches. 

The study is written in MATLAB R2018a
