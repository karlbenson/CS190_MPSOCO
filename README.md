# CS190_MPSOCO
A repo from my research entitled "A Modified Particle Swarm Optimizer with Crossover Operator (M-PSOCO) using Dynamic Inertia Weight." This study follows through Chen's research entitled "Particle swarm optimizer with crossover operation" by modifying the inertia weight parameter. This study will carry out two adaptive inertia weight methods and will be compared to a linearly decreasing weight PSO.
